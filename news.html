            <h2>Record Temperatures in 2024</h2>
            <p>This year has seen record-breaking global temperatures, with several regions experiencing heatwaves that have surpassed historical averages. According to data from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the first half of 2024 was the hottest ever recorded globally, with surface temperatures averaging 1.3°C above pre-industrial levels. This sharp rise in temperature is attributed to a combination of human-driven greenhouse gas emissions and natural climate phenomena such as El Niño.</p>

            <h2>Carbon Emissions: A Critical Crossroads</h2>
            <p>While global emissions have slightly plateaued in some regions, the overall trajectory remains concerning. The latest report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggests that global CO2 emissions must be halved by 2030 to meet the targets set by the Paris Agreement. However, many countries are falling short of their emission reduction commitments, and the transition to renewable energy is progressing too slowly to avoid catastrophic warming</p>

            <h2>Global Climate Summit 2024: Urgent Calls for Action</h2>
            <p>The 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) recently concluded with urgent calls for more ambitious action. Leaders from around the world acknowledged that the current pace of action is insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The summit highlighted the need for increased investment in green technologies, international cooperation, and more stringent policies to curb emissions.</p>

            <h2> UN Climate Summit Calls for Urgent Action</h2>
            <p>At the 2024 COP29 summit, world leaders warned that current climate policies are insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C target. Calls for stronger commitments to cut emissions and invest in renewable energy were a central focus.</p>

            <br>
            <h2> Extreme Weather Events Increasing</h2>
            <p>The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods, have increased significantly. In 2024, multiple regions, including the US, South Asia, and Europe, have experienced catastrophic climate-related disasters.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2> Food Security Under Threat</h2>
            <p>The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns that climate change is severely impacting food security, with global crop yields expected to decrease by 10-30% in many regions by 2050. For example, in India—the world’s second-largest producer of rice—rising temperatures have already led to a decline of 2-4% in rice yields per decade. In sub-Saharan Africa, prolonged droughts and unpredictable rainfall patterns have reduced maize and wheat production, leading to significant food shortages and rising prices.

            <h2> Greenhouse Gas Concentrations Continue to Rise</h2>
            <p>The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere reached a new milestone in 2024. The Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii recorded an average CO2 concentration of 419.5 ppm (parts per million) in May 2024, the highest level in 800,000 years, based on ice core data. This continuing increase in greenhouse gases is a primary driver of global warming and its associated impacts.</p>

            <h2> UN Climate Summit Urges Immediate Action</h2>
            <p>At the COP29 climate summit held in November 2024, world leaders warned that current climate action is insufficient to limit global warming to the 1.5°C target. The UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for emergency measures to scale up renewable energy, implement carbon taxes, and end fossil fuel subsidies. Scientists urge nations to halve emissions by 2030 and aim for net-zero emissions by 2050 to avoid catastrophic impacts.
