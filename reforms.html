            <h1>Important International Agreements on Global Warming</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><h3>The Paris Agreement (2015)</h3>

                Goal: Limit global warming to well below 2°C, with efforts to restrict it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
                <br>
                
                Commitments: Countries set their own climate targets (Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
                <br>
                Monitoring: A system for tracking progress and increasing ambition over time.
                <br>
                Financial Support: Developed countries are encouraged to support developing nations with financial resources and technology to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
                <br>
                Long-Term Goal: Achieve net-zero emissions by around 2050 to stabilize the climate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
            <h3>Kyoto Protocol (1997)</h3>
                
                Goal: Legally binding targets for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.
                <br>
                Scope: Focused primarily on industrialized nations, which were historically the biggest polluters.
                <br>
                Mechanisms:
                Emissions Trading: Allows countries to buy and sell emissions allowances.
                <br>
                Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): Encouraged emission-reducing projects in developing countries.
                <br>
                Limitations: The U.S. did not ratify the treaty, and some countries failed to meet their targets, limiting its overall effectiveness.
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Montreal Protocol (1987)</h3>
                
                Goal: Phased out the use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS), such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which also have a significant impact on global warming.
                <br>
                Success: Widely regarded as a success in environmental diplomacy, with countries meeting their targets ahead of schedule, leading to recovery of the ozone layer.
                <br>
                Connection to Climate Change: Many of the substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol also contribute to global warming, so its success has indirect benefits for reducing greenhouse gases.</p>

            <h1>Key Steps for Reform and Future Action on Global Warming</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><h3>Accelerating Transition to Renewable Energy</h3>
                <br>

                Goal: Shift from fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro.
                Steps:
                Invest in clean energy infrastructure.
                <br>
                Promote energy efficiency across industries, transportation, and residential sectors.
                <br>
                Subsidize renewable energy technologies and phase out fossil fuel subsidies.
                <br>
                <br>
               <h3> Carbon Pricing</h3>
               <br>
                
                Goal: Make carbon emissions more expensive to incentivize companies and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint.
                Steps:
                <br>
                Implement carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems.
                <br>
                Ensure fair and equitable pricing, so that the burden does not disproportionately fall on low-income communities.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Climate Finance and Technology Transfer</h3>
                <br>
                
                Goal: Provide financial and technological support to developing countries to help them transition to cleaner economies and adapt to climate impacts.
                <br>

                Steps:
                Developed nations must fulfill their pledge to mobilize $100 billion per year in climate finance.
                Increase the transfer of low-carbon technologies to the Global South.

                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Reforestation and Carbon Sequestration</h3>
                <br>
                
                Goal: Enhance the natural capacity of ecosystems to absorb CO2.
                <br>
                Steps:
                Implement large-scale reforestation and afforestation projects.
                Support the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Promoting Sustainable Agriculture</h3>
                <br>
                
                Goal: Shift towards more sustainable agricultural practices that reduce emissions, increase soil carbon storage, and improve resilience to climate impacts.
                <br>
                Steps:
                Encourage agroecology, no-till farming, crop rotation, and reduced use of synthetic fertilizers.
                Support local food systems and reduce food waste.
                <br>

                <br>
                <h3>strengthening Adaptation Measures</h3>
                <br>
                Goal: Prepare for and mitigate the impacts of climate change, particularly in vulnerable regions.
                <br>
                Steps:
                Develop resilient infrastructure in coastal cities to protect against rising sea levels and storms.
                Improve early-warning systems and disaster preparedness.<br>
                Increase funding for climate adaptation projects in developing nations.
