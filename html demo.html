                    <p class="text-small">Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O). These gases trap heat in the atmosphere,
                         creating a "greenhouse effect" that causes the planet to warm. The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions include the burning of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices. As a result, global temperatures have been rising steadily,
                          leading to a wide range of environmental and social impacts, such as melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture. Global warming is a key driver of climate change and poses significant challenges to both natural and human systems worldwide</p>
                    <p class="text-small">
                        Global warming is one of the most urgent challenges facing our planet today. It is a problem that transcends borders,
                         affecting ecosystems, economies, and communities worldwide. Addressing global warming requires a collective effort to reduce carbon emissions,
                          transition to renewable energy sources, and adopt sustainable practices in every aspect of life.
                           As technology and innovation continue to evolve, there are more solutions than ever before to help mitigate climate change.
                            Whether through policy changes, individual action, or advancements in clean energy, we all have a role to play in safeguarding the future of our planet.
                            Together, we can create a more resilient, sustainable world for generations to come.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface by trapping heat in the atmosphere. When sunlight reaches the Earth, some of it is absorbed, warming the surface,
                 while the rest is reflected back into space as infrared radiation (heat). Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor in the atmosphere absorb and re-radiate this infrared radiation, keeping the heat within the atmosphere and preventing it from escaping into space.
                  This process is essential for maintaining Earth's temperature and supporting life. However, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are increasing the concentration of these greenhouse gases, intensifying the greenhouse effect and contributing to global warming and climate change.</p>

            <h1 class="sectionTag text-big">Effects of Global warming</h1>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The effects of global warming are already being felt across the world and are projected to intensify in the coming decades. One of the most immediate consequences is the rise in average global temperatures, 
                which leads to more frequent and severe heatwaves, threatening human health, agriculture, and water supplies. Warmer temperatures also contribute to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, which results in rising sea levels,
                 putting coastal cities and low-lying islands at risk of flooding. This process not only displaces communities but also harms marine ecosystems and disrupts livelihoods dependent on coastal areas. Additionally,
                  the changing climate is triggering more extreme weather events, such as stronger hurricanes, intense rainfall, and prolonged droughts. These disruptions damage infrastructure, strain food and water resources, and increase the frequency of wildfires. 
                  Ecosystems and wildlife are also under threat, with species struggling to adapt to changing temperatures or losing their habitats altogether. As ecosystems become destabilized, there is a cascading effect on biodiversity, further destabilizing the planet ecological balance. 
                  Agriculture, too, faces significant challenges, with shifting weather patterns affecting crop yields and creating food insecurity in many regions.</p>
